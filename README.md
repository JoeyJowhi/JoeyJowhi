Iâ€™m @JoeyJowhi!
#### Interests
I play a lot of games but I tend to gravitate toward survival games like Project Zomboid and colony sims like Rimworld. Though these examples are specific, I love many different genres! I love FPS games like ULTRAKILL, Call of Duty and *sometimes* Counterstrike and many others!

I LOVE music but metal music specifically, I play guitar and enjoy extreme genres such as BDM, Technical Death Metal, Slam Metal and Deathgrind I also enjoy many other genres like Thrash or Doom Metal! Music that isn't metal is good too, like indie and rap! Seriously, I like so many genres - I'll probably like something at least similar to what you like!

My other main interests includes movies, tv shows, anime and manga. My favourite movies are The Shawshank Redemption, Django Unchained and Whiplash. My favourite shows are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones ~~and a sinister fourth option~~. My favourite anime and manga are JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Piece and Deathnote. I will watch/read any genre because to me, a good story is a good story!

#### Learning
I'm attending the Software Development program at Keyin College and I'm currently at the end of my first semester!
