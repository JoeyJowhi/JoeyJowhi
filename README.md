### Personality
I'm a very introverted and shy person as well as a bit of a recluse. Although once I get to know you I tend to open up pretty quick! I have ADD so the way I approach my work can fluctuate. Typically, it is not uncommon for me to "no-life" a project or goal until I finish it. Though as ADD goes, this eventually results in burnout. Which is why you may also see me play one game and one game only for like an entire month straight and then not touch it again until the next year. Moving away from all that, I also take a non-serious approach to most things (within reason, of course). Be funny! Be silly and joyous!

### Interests
I play a lot of games but I tend to gravitate toward survival games like **Project Zomboid** and colony sims like **Rimworld**. Though these examples are specific, I love many different genres. I love FPS games like **ULTRAKILL**, **Call of Duty** and *sometimes* **Counterstrike** and many Gacha titles such as **Genshin Impact** and **Honkai: Star Rail**!

I LOVE music but metal music specifically, I play guitar and enjoy extreme genres such as **BDM**, **Technical Death Metal** and **Deathgrind**, I also enjoy many other genres like **Thrash** or **Doom Metal** (I LOOOOVE DOOM METAL)! Music that isn't metal is good too, like **Indie** and **Rap/Hip-Hop**! Seriously, I like so many genres - I'll probably like something at least similar to what you like! Here's a quick top 5 to help convey my tastes better.

**My Top 5 Bands**<br>
**1. Black Sabbath** (I love Tony Iommi and literally anything he has touched, I listen to all 20 Black Sabbath albums (Including **The Devil You Know**), I listen to his solo releases, I listen to songs he's featured on including the *WhoCares* album.)<br>
**2. Slayer** (All albums (Yes, even **Diabolus In Musica**) and Kerry King's current band.)<br>
**3. Dying F...** (Censored this and the next name in case it makes anyone uncomfy.)<br>
**4. Cattle D...**<br>
**5. Cryptopsy**

My other main interests includes movies, TV shows, anime and manga. My favourite movies are **The Shawshank Redemption**, **The Green Mile**, **Django: Unchained** and **Whiplash**. My favourite shows are **Breaking Bad**, **Better Call Saul**, **The Walking Dead**, **Game of Thrones** ~~and a sinister fifth option~~. My favourite anime and manga are **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**, **One Piece** and **Deathnote**. I will watch/read any genre because to me, a good story is a good story!

Aesthetics-wise, I absolutely adore apocalyptic themes so I find myself attracted to most zombie related media. This is one of the main reasons as to why **Project Zomboid** is my favourite game and why **The Walking Dead** is one of my favourite shows. Seeing the characters and the world change in behaviour as years go by, watching the infrastructure of the world slowly decay, and I especially love the poetic adornment of nature taking over what used to be sprawling concrete jungles.

Oh and uhhhh my favourite colour is black!
