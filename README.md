#### Interests
I play a lot of games but I tend to gravitate toward survival games like Project Zomboid and colony sims like Rimworld. Though these examples are specific, I love many different genres! I love FPS games like ULTRAKILL, Call of Duty and *sometimes* Counterstrike and many others!

I LOVE music but metal music specifically, I play guitar and enjoy extreme genres such as BDM, Technical Death Metal and Deathgrind, I also enjoy many other genres like Thrash or Doom Metal (I LOOOOVE DOOM METAL)! Music that isn't metal is good too, like indie and rap! Seriously, I like so many genres - I'll probably like something at least similar to what you like!

My other main interests includes movies, tv shows, anime and manga. My favourite movies are The Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, Django: Unchained and Whiplash. My favourite shows are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones ~~and a sinister fifth option~~. My favourite anime and manga are JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Piece and Deathnote. I will watch/read any genre because to me, a good story is a good story!

Aesthetics-wise, I absolutely adore apocalyptic themes so I find myself attracted to most zombie related media. This is one of the main reasons as to why Project Zomboid is my favourite game and why The Walking Dead is one of my favourite shows. Seeing the characters and the world change in behaviour as years go by, watching the infrastructure of the world slowly decay and I especially love the poetic adornment of nature taking over what used to be sprawling concrete jungles.

Oh and uhhhh my favourite colour is black!
